<h1>Thanks for updating Fontsampler!</h1>
    <div class="text-box">
        <div class="notice notice-warning">
            <p>This updated fixes an issue with writing CSS files. If you had Fontsampler settings that did not get correctly applied, please re-save the general and specific settings. Furthermore, there is no indication the other fixed issue has caused any security exploits on any installs of Fontsampler, but is merely a precaution to make the code of Fontsampler even more bullet proof.</p>
